Oreganized is a mod inspired by the 1.17 inclusion of Copper in minecraft and imagines how would 2 new metals look like if they were added today.
Each with their unique niches and themes.

Silver ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/silver_ingot.png){ .inline-icon } can be made into Mirrors, [Scribe](scribe.md), [Gargoyles](gargoyle.md) and make a new alloy called [Electrum](electrum.md).

Lead ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/lead_ingot.png){ .inline-icon } can be used for [decoration](lead-decoration.md), melted and for [Lead Bolts](lead-bolt.md) - new projectiles!
The world is also filled with an adjacent features to the metals like the new Boulders which you can find in plains that are the source of a new stone type
