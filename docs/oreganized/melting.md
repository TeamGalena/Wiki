# Melting

When subjected to heat, blocks made out of lead will start to melt.

Placing them directly next to a heat source like campfires ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/minecraft/campfire.png){ .inline-icon },
magma blocks ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/minecraft/magma_block.png){ .inline-icon } or lava ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/minecraft/lava_bucket.png){ .inline-icon }
will cause them to turn into a red hot state, look indistinguishable from one another.

Lead blocks placed next to goopy blocks will turn into their goopy form.

These molten states of blocks will hurt when standing on them. Some blocks, like the
[lead door ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/lead_door.png){ .inline-icon }](lead-decoration.md#lead-doors),
[lead bulb ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/lead_bulb.png){ .inline-icon }](lead-bulb.md) or
[lead bars ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/lead_bars.png){ .inline-icon }](lead-decoration.md#lead-bars)
also behave differently based on their heat level.
