# Decorative Lead Blocks

### Lead Blocks

There are different decorative blocks made out of lead. Like most things made out of lead, the will start to melt when placed next to a heat source (See [Melting](melting.md))

### Lead Doors

<div class="grid aside" markdown>

<div markdown>
Lead doors and trapdoors work the same and have two features that differentiate them from other doors.
They cannot be opened using redstone but only by hand.
Instead of openening instantly, players need to press a few seconds to push them open.
Letting go of the door will cause it to close after a second again.

The second mechanic is that similar to other lead blocks, heating affects the way they can be used.
Melting it into the goopy state, damage cause the players while they press it open,
in the red hot state it will only hurt but not even open anymore.

### Lead Bars

Lead bars are more fragile than other lead blocks. This prevents them from reforming after being completely molten into the red hot state.
Instead, when mined in this state or when they cool down again, they break down and drop a few lead nuggets ![]({{ hosts.icons }}/oreganized/lead_nugget.png){ .inline-icon }
